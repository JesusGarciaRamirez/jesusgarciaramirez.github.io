## EXPERIENCE

**PhD Researcher** , KU Leuven _Jan 2022 - Present_

- Developed an **accurate (** 80% explained variance) **CNN** -based model for predicting neuron responses to images, bridg-
    ing the gap between **computational** and biological **vision**.
- **Optimized** Receptive Field estimation by designing a novel **Gaussian approximation** , reducing fitting parameters
    by thousands.
- Implemented a **closed-loop pipeline** leveraging CNN encoding models, successfully identifying optimal stimuli for
    recorded neurons within a **high-pressure** , one-day **experiment**.
- Created an **end-to-end** interactive **visualization** to enhance model **interpretability** and facilitate **communication**
    with non-technical **stakeholders**.

**Research Engineer** , KU Leuven _Jan 2021 - Dec 2021_

- Engineered a highly **accurate (** 92% success rate) and **fast** (microsecond inference) **Brain Machine Interface** system
    using a non-linear extension of Kalman filter, enabling **real-time control** for individuals with reduced mobility
- Developed an innovative **online retraining** procedure to reduce the amount of required training data resulting in a
    90% data utilization reduction, paving the way for broader accessibility.
- Led a **cross-functional team** of researchers, engineers, and non-technical stakeholders to **deliver** the **solution** 6
    months **early** , exceeding expectations.

## PROJECTS

**Efficient analysis of mobile eye tracker data using Deep Learning**

- Developed an **automatic labelling tool** to streamline the analysis of mobile **eye-tracking** recordings from an art
    exhibition
- **Finetuned a** video classification **model** (SlowFast) using curated 10k sample dataset, **reducing manual workload**
    **o** n 80% with 90% accuracy
- **Adapted** Resnet to handle **multidimensional time-series da** ta for behaviour prediction, achieving 60% automation
    with 80% accuracy
